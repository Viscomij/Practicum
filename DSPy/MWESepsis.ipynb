       "\"Progress Notes \\nPatient Name: John Doe \\nMRN: 12345678 \\nDate of Admission: 2024-06-10 \\nDate of Note: 2024-06-13 \\nAttending Physician: Dr. Jane Smith \\nUnit: ICU \\n \\nSubjective: \\nPatient is a 65-year-old male with a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus who was \\nadmitted three days ago with high fever, chills, and confusion. The patient's family reports that \\nhe has been feeling progressively worse over the past week and had a fever of 102°F at home. He \\nwas brought to the emergency department where he was found to be hypotensive and \\ntachycardic. \\nObjective: \\n• \\nVitals: \\no Temperature: 101.8°F \\no Heart Rate: 110 bpm \\no Blood Pressure: 85/55 mmHg \\no Respiratory Rate: 24 breaths/min \\no SpO2: 92% on room air \\n• \\nPhysical Exam: \\no General: Ill-appearing, diaphoretic \\no HEENT: No significant findings \\no Cardiovascular: Tachycardia, no murmurs \\no Respiratory: Tachypneic, coarse crackles at bases \\no Abdomen: Soft, non-tender \\no Extremities: No edema \\no Neurological: Alert, oriented to person only, follows simple commands \\n• \\nLabs/Imaging: \\no CBC: WBC 18,000/µL, Hgb 12.5 g/dL, Platelets 150,000/µL \\no BMP: Na 138 mmol/L, K 4.2 mmol/L, Cl 102 mmol/L, HCO3 20 mmol/L, BUN \\n28 mg/dL, Cr 1.8 mg/dL, Glucose 190 mg/dL \\no Lactic Acid: 4.5 mmol/L \\no Blood Cultures: Pending \\no Chest X-ray: Bilateral infiltrates \\nAssessment: \\n1. Sepsis secondary to presumed pneumonia: \\no The patient presents with fever, tachycardia, hypotension, and respiratory distress. \\nBlood cultures are pending. \\no Elevated WBC and lactic acid levels indicate significant infection and \\nhypoperfusion. \\n2. Hypertension: \\no History of hypertension, currently managed with home medications. \\n3. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: \\no Chronic condition, currently on metformin. \\nPlan: \\n1. Sepsis: \\no Continue IV fluids and broad-spectrum antibiotics (Vancomycin and Piperacillin-\\nTazobactam). \\no Monitor vitals closely. \\no Repeat lactate level in 6 hours. \\no Transfer to ICU for close monitoring and possible vasopressor support. \\n2. Hypertension: \\no Hold antihypertensive medications due to current hypotension. \\n3. Diabetes Management: \\no Monitor blood glucose levels every 4 hours. \\no Continue sliding scale insulin. \\n \\nFollow-Up Note (2024-06-14): \\nSubjective: \\nPatient shows slight improvement in mental status, now oriented to person and place. Fever \\npersists. The family reports that he had been in close contact with a relative who was recently \\ndiagnosed with influenza. \\nObjective: \\n• \\nVitals: \\no Temperature: 100.5°F \\no Heart Rate: 100 bpm \\no Blood Pressure: 90/60 mmHg \\no Respiratory Rate: 20 breaths/min \\no SpO2: 94% on room air \\n• \\nLabs/Imaging: \\no Repeat Lactic Acid: 3.0 mmol/L \\no Blood Cultures: Negative \\no Influenza PCR: Positive for Influenza A \\nAssessment: \\n1. Influenza with secondary bacterial infection: \\no Initial presentation suggested sepsis, but blood cultures are negative and influenza \\nPCR is positive. \\no Likely secondary bacterial pneumonia contributing to the sepsis-like picture. \\n2. Hypertension: \\no Continue to hold antihypertensive medications due to ongoing relative \\nhypotension. \\n3. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: \\no Continue monitoring and sliding scale insulin. \\nPlan: \\n1. Influenza: \\no Discontinue broad-spectrum antibiotics. \\no Start antiviral therapy (Oseltamivir). \\no Continue supportive care with fluids and antipyretics. \\no Monitor for any signs of secondary bacterial infection. \\n2. Hypertension: \\no Re-evaluate blood pressure management once the patient stabilizes. \\n3. Diabetes Management: \\no Continue monitoring and sliding scale insulin. \\no Adjust insulin doses as needed based on blood glucose readings. \\n \\nSigned: \\nDr. Jane Smith, MD \\nAttending Physician \\n4o \\n \\n\""
